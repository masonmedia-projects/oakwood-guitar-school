Guitar playing is actually more physical than one would think, and proper warmups are a key to success so we always spend 1 - 5 minutes on these.</p>\n<hr>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technical exercises and/or ear training:</strong><br>\nThe student will have a variety of different things in this category, these could be chords progressions, chord exercises, melodies, learning melodies by ear.  More often than not we will do exercises with rhythm because it is a major component of all styles of music and can be transferred to other instruments.  This usually takes anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes and is always progressively built on the previous weeks exercises, and also will directly influence the songs we will learn.</p>\n<hr>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Songs or Repertoire:</strong><br>\nAt least half of each lesson is dedicated to playing music, because that's what its all about!  For the first year of lessons if you are a new guitar player the teacher will often provide the bulk of the songs we will play to help complement the technical ability of the student.  These could be single note melodies for awhile and later on strumming chords.  Students are always encouraged to bring in song suggestions but be prepared for some of those songs to be more challenging than they sound!  Keep in mind most music you hear on guitar is played by a professional or very experienced guitar player, and you may spend years trying to get where you would like to be.  That said, with dedication and consistency you can also surprise yourself with your own progress, so keep it up!  The songs will usually fill out the remainder of the lesson until its time to go home.  </li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Variation, flexibility, and questions</strong></h2>\n<hr>\n<p>The outline above reflects a typical lesson, but as with most things in life, lessons at OGS are fluid and flexible; the more advanced the student becomes, the more variety in the shape of lessons.  And always remember to ask questions if you are not sure of the lesson notes or what the student should be doing at home!  </p>\n<hr>\n<h5><strong>Please <a href=\"mailto:info@oakwoodguitarschool.com\" title=\"Oakwood Guitar School\">contact us</a> for more information or if you have any questions!</strong></h5>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 04, 2020","slug":"/typical-lesson","title":"Lessons at OGS","subtitle":"What happens in a Lesson?","logo":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='134'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20134'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M42%201l-5%201c-4%201-15%208-18%2011C10%2023%208%2030%206%2056c0%206-1%208-2%208-2%200-2%203%200%205%202%201%202%203%203%2013%201%2030%207%2040%2029%2049%208%203%2028%200%2041-6%2030-14%2037-14%2054-7%2010%205%2027%206%2033%203%207-5%207-11-2-15-15-6-19-10-19-17%200-10%203-10%2033-11l91-1c70-1%2073-1%2082%203%2010%204%2016%205%2029%201%201%200%203%200%205%202%208%206%2021-2%2016-10-2-3-2-3%200-4%203-3-1-7-6-6-1%201-2%200-3-1l-5-1-4-1c0-1-5-3-6-2s-2%201-3-1c-3-4-10-3-9%201v2l-1-3c0-3-2-5-6-5-1%201-3%200-4-1-3-3-6-2-7%201%200%202-1%202-3%202-3-1-4%200-8%202l-3%203h-29a10320%2010320%200%2000-136-3c-3-3%203-20%207-19%203%200%204-3%201-5l-2-5c-3-15-18-19-39-11-16%206-26%207-34%203A718%20718%200%200052%201H42'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":2.9838709677419355,"src":"/static/29ce24c2e344fe2ea6a7d5ac28625d16/7d588/ogs_tele_icon_crop.png","srcSet":"/static/29ce24c2e344fe2ea6a7d5ac28625d16/7d588/ogs_tele_icon_crop.png 185w","sizes":"(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px"}}},"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5027932960893855,"src":"/static/95f6d49efc329b4f6a5ab6f2ddb07ac6/9392c/ogs_marshall.jpg","srcSet":"/static/95f6d49efc329b4f6a5ab6f2ddb07ac6/bf31d/ogs_marshall.jpg 269w,\n/static/95f6d49efc329b4f6a5ab6f2ddb07ac6/23af0/ogs_marshall.jpg 538w,\n/static/95f6d49efc329b4f6a5ab6f2ddb07ac6/9392c/ogs_marshall.jpg 1075w,\n/static/95f6d49efc329b4f6a5ab6f2ddb07ac6/c5f20/ogs_marshall.jpg 1613w,\n/static/95f6d49efc329b4f6a5ab6f2ddb07ac6/e22ca/ogs_marshall.jpg 1880w","sizes":"(max-width: 1075px) 100vw, 1075px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/typical-lesson"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3041095740"]}
